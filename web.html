<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using Dockerfile Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7.<br>
2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.<br>
3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.<br>
4. Job1 : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.<br>
5. Job2 :(1). By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes ( eg. If code    is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed )<br>
   (2) Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod.<br>
   (3) Make the data to remain persistent ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )<br>
6. Job3 : Test your app if it is working or not.<br>
7. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the developer.<br>
